If any clause in this Licence is held by a court of law to be illegal or unenforceable the remaining provisions of this Licence shall not be affected thereby. The failure by ARM to enforce any of the provisions of this Licence, unless waived in writing, shall not constitute a waiver of ARM’s rights to enforce such provision or any other provision of this Licence in the future.

You agree to comply fully with all laws and regulations of the United States and other countries (“Export Laws”) to assure that the Deliverables are not (1) exported, directly or indirectly, in violation of Export Laws, either to any countries that are subject to U.S.A. export restrictions or to any end user who has been prohibited from participating in the U.S.A. export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S.A. government; or (2) intended to be used for any purpose prohibited by Export Laws, including, without limitation, nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons proliferation.
